# GUI_Graphing

A Java + JavaFX application that lets users build and visualize graphs interactively. You can add vertices, connect them (i.e. create edges), and see your graph structure in a GUI.

---

## Overview

GUI_Graphing is an interactive tool for creating and manipulating graphs via a graphical user interface. Users can:

- Add vertices (nodes)  
- Connect vertices to form edges  
- (Optionally) Remove vertices/edges  
- Visualize the resulting graph dynamically  

Itâ€™s a useful learning/demonstration tool for graph theory concepts and for getting comfortable with JavaFX-based GUI programming.

## Features

- Add vertices by clicking (or using a UI button)  
- Connect two vertices to create an edge between them  
- Display vertices and edges on a canvas or pane  
- Update the display in real time as graph changes  
- (If implemented) Remove vertices/edges, move vertices, change appearance

## Technologies

- Java   
- JavaFX for GUI (layout, event handling, drawing)
